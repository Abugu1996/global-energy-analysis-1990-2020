# global-energy-analysis-1990-2020
Comprehensive analysis of global energy data (1990–2020), exploring consumption, production, renewable adoption, and CO₂ emissions. Includes KPIs, interactive dashboards, and insights to support sustainability and energy policy decisions.
# Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze global energy production, consumption, and sustainability patterns between 1990 and 2020. By exploring key energy indicators, the project provides insights into the transition towards renewable energy, CO₂ emissions trends, and country-level energy use.

# Dataset Used
File: Energy data 1990 - 2020.csv
Features include:
Total energy consumption
Energy production by source
Electricity generation (renewable vs. non-renewable)
CO₂ emissions
Country-level breakdowns

# Key Questions (KPIs)
1. How has global energy consumption and production changed over time?
2. What is the share of renewable energy compared to fossil fuels across regions?
3. How do CO₂ emissions correlate with energy production and consumption?

# Process
1. Data Loading & Inspection – Load dataset, check for missing values, duplicates, and data types.
2. Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identify consumption/production trends, renewable share, and emission patterns.
3. KPI Generation – Calculate renewable energy ratios, per-country CO₂ intensity, and growth rates.
4. Visualization – Generate plots (time series, bar charts, correlation plots).
5. Documentation – Save results in google colab and prepare insights for GitHub.

# Dashboard

 was created to summarize findings. Suggested views include:

1. Global Energy Consumption & Production Trend (1990–2020)
. Renewable Energy Share (%) by Country/Region
3. CO₂ Emissions vs. Energy Use Correlation
4. Top 10 Energy Producers & Consumers
5. share of electricity in final energy consumption

# Project Insights

. Global Energy Consumption & Production (KPI 1):
Consumption and production both rose between 1990 and 2020, but consumption often exceeded production in certain regions. This indicates increasing reliance on imports and greater strain on global supply.

. Renewable Energy Share (KPI 2):
Renewables grew rapidly after 2010, with Europe and Asia driving most of the gains. However, fossil fuels still dominate the global energy mix, and renewable adoption remains uneven across regions.

. CO₂ Emissions vs. Energy Use (KPI 3):
The dashboard shows a strong link between energy consumption and emissions. Countries with high industrial activity (e.g., USA, China, India) are also the largest CO₂ emitters. Renewable-heavy regions show slower emissions growth, proving the value of clean energy adoption.

. Top Producers & Consumers (Dashboard Result):
The top 10 producers and consumers are concentrated among industrialized and rapidly developing economies. These regions hold the greatest potential for impactful energy and climate policies.

. Electricity Generation Mix (Dashboard Result):
Electricity generation is slowly diversifying. While coal and oil remain significant, natural gas and renewables are steadily increasing, signaling a gradual but important shift toward cleaner energy.

# Final Conclusion

The 1990–2020 energy data reveals a clear story: energy demand is rising worldwide, fossil fuels still dominate, and renewable energy though growing has not yet overtaken them. Industrialized and fast-growing economies drive most of the world’s energy use and CO₂ emissions, making them central to achieving global sustainability goals.

The project underscores that progress toward a cleaner energy future is real but too slow. A sustainable balance will require accelerated renewable adoption, stronger climate policies, and technological innovation to reduce emissions while meeting the world’s growing energy needs.
