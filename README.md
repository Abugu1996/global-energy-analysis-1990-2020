# global-energy-analysis-1990-2020
Comprehensive analysis of global energy data (1990–2020), exploring consumption, production, renewable adoption, and CO₂ emissions. Includes KPIs, interactive dashboards, and insights to support sustainability and energy policy decisions.
# Project Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze global energy production, consumption, and sustainability patterns between 1990 and 2020. By exploring key energy indicators, the project provides insights into the transition towards renewable energy, CO₂ emissions trends, and country-level energy use.

# Dataset Used
File: Energy data 1990 - 2020.csv
Features include:
Total energy consumption
Energy production by source
Electricity generation (renewable vs. non-renewable)
CO₂ emissions
Country-level breakdowns

# Key Questions (KPIs)
1. How has global energy consumption and production changed over time?
2. What is the share of renewable energy compared to fossil fuels across regions?
3. How do CO₂ emissions correlate with energy production and consumption?

# Process
1. Data Loading & Inspection – Load dataset, check for missing values, duplicates, and data types.
2. Data Cleaning – Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identify consumption/production trends, renewable share, and emission patterns.
3. KPI Generation – Calculate renewable energy ratios, per-country CO₂ intensity, and growth rates.
4. Visualization – Generate plots (time series, bar charts, correlation plots).
5. Documentation – Save results in google colab and prepare insights for GitHub.
# Dashboard

 was created to summarize findings. Suggested views include:

Global Energy Consumption & Production Trend (1990–2020)
Renewable Energy Share (%) by Country/Region
CO₂ Emissions vs. Energy Use Correlation
Top 10 Energy Producers & Consumers
share of electricity in final energy consumption
